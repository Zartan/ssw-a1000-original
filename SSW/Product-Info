2 player space war game in 53 systems.
.description
Solar System Wars is a game similar to Space Wars, pitting two players
against each other, in orbit around 0 to 4 stars.  Choose from 53
different solar systems, or turn on the random system selector for a
new challenge every round.  A variety of weapons are available.  Two or
three button joysticks are strongly recommended, but not required.
Both NTSC and PAL are supported.  Binary only.

New in version 1.38:

* Fixed bug that sometimes left torpedo pixels on the screen when a
  Cluster Pod popped.

* Fixed glitch in joystick routines that made a Cloaked ship flicker if
  you tried Hyperspace at the same time.

* Made the Disruptor more disruptive.  When hit, a ship will accelerate
  with quad thrust while spinning.
